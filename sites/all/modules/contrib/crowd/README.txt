General Information
-------------------

This module provides single sign-on integration with Atlassian's Crowd
application. It supports the detection of the Crowd SSO cookie to provide
automatic login of users already authenticated via Crowd. Drupal accounts are
created automatically if the user account doesn't already exist. The module also
modifies the standard Drupal user login form validation handlers to authenticate
directly against Crowd instead of Drupal (with an optional Drupal fallback).


Installation and Usage
----------------------

Please see the project page at http://drupal.org/project/crowd for full usage
specifics and documentation.
